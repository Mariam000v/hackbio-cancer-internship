HackBio Internship 2024
Biomarker Discovery â€“ Clinical Oncology Track

This project was conducted as part of the HackBio 2024 internship under the Biomarker Discovery track, focusing on clinical oncology. We explored RNA-Seq data to identify potential biomarkers associated with cancer progression and diagnosis.

Objectives: 
- Preprocess and analyze RNA-Seq data

- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

- Perform functional enrichment analysis

- Visualize key pathways relevant to cancer biology

Tools & Technologies:
- R, Bioconductor packages (DESeq2, edgeR, clusterProfiler, etc.)

- Python, Bash (for data handling & automation)

- Databases: Ensembl, KEGG, Gene Ontology (GO)

Key Outcomes:
- Identified significantly up- and downregulated genes in cancer datasets

- Enriched pathways related to immune response, cell cycle, and apoptosis

- Proposed candidate biomarkers for future experimental validation

Team Acknowledgment:
Grateful for the collaborative and educational experience provided by HackBio and all team members involved in this project.
