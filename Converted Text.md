Authors (@slack): Mariam Mohamed (@Mariam000v)

 

Tp53 is a crucial tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17. Ever since its important role as a tumor suppressor gene has been discovered, TP53 has become a major target in cancer treatments and therapies <!--[if supportFields]><span

Tp53 mutations are significant hallmarks of cancer as \~50% of human cancers, TP53 malfunction/mutations were observed. Defections in TP53 not only induce tumorigenesis, but also prevent malignant cell response to anticancer drugs, as Gain of Function (GOF) is one of the major concerns about TP53 mutations, giving the mutated proteins ontogenetic properties such as promoting cell survival, invasion and metastasis, and it can contribute to cancer progression by altering the microenvironment around the tumor to support it <!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:field-begin;mso-field-lock:

**P53 and its role against cancer**

TP53 encodes for the P53 protein, which is often referred as “the guardian of the genome”. p53 prevents tumor formation by responding to cellular stress and DNA damage, as it regulates whether a damaged cell should have a DNA damage repair or undergo programmed cell death. P53 can arrest cell cycle at G1/S checkpoint to allow DNA repair proteins to fix the cell. If the cell is irreparable, then apoptosis take place. Therefore, when p53 is mutated, the defected cells fail to be removed or repaired and continue to grow and multiplicate, which can lead to serious issues in the human genome and cells leading to more defected cells and uncontrolled cell proliferation, eventually cancer<!--[if supportFields]><span

One of the drugs that have been designed to restore p53 function is a drug called <a id="_Hlk176366233"></a>), which showed promises in early trials when it was combined with other cancer therapeutic methods. However, this drug has challenges and limitations as its effectiveness varies depending on Tp53 mutations, where in some mutations, this drug cannot reactivate TP53. Also, this drug toxicity and safety is still under investigation<!--[if supportFields]><span

is a critical tumor-suppressor gene that is mutated in more than half of all
human cancers. Mutations in TP53 not only impair its antitumor activity, but
also confer mutant p53 protein oncogenic properties. The p53-targeted therapy
approach began with the identification of compounds capable of
restoring/reactivating wild-type p53 functions or eliminating mutant p53.
Treatments that directly target mutant p53 are extremely structure and
drug-species-dependent. Due to the mutation of wild-type p53, multiple survival
pathways that are normally maintained by wild-type p53 are disrupted,
necessitating the activation of compensatory genes or pathways to promote
cancer cell survival. Additionally, because the oncogenic functions of mutant
p53 contribute to cancer proliferation and metastasis, targeting the signaling
pathways altered by p53 mutation appears to be an attractive strategy.
Synthetic lethality implies that while disruption of either gene alone is
permissible among two genes with synthetic lethal interactions, complete
disruption of both genes results in cell death. Thus, rather than directly
targeting p53, exploiting mutant p53 synthetic lethal genes may provide
additional therapeutic benefits. Additionally, research progress on the
functions of noncoding RNAs has made it clear that disrupting noncoding RNA
networks has a favorable antitumor effect, supporting the hypothesis that
targeting noncoding RNAs may have potential synthetic lethal effects in cancers
with p53 mutations. The purpose of this review is to discuss treatments for
cancers with mutant p53 that focus on directly targeting mutant p53, restoring
wild-type functions, and exploiting synthetic lethal interactions with mutant
p53. Additionally, the possibility of noncoding RNAs acting as synthetic lethal
targets for mutant p53 will be
discussed.&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Hu&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jiahao&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Cao&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jiasheng&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Topatana&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Win&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Juengpanich&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Sarun&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Li&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Shijie&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Zhang&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Bin&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Shen&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jiliang&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Cai&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Liuxin&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Cai&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Xiujun&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Chen&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Mingyu&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;}],&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Journal

**Conclusion**

 TP53 gene, which encodes p53, remains a major critical target in curing cancer therapy. As mentioned earlier, due to the multifunction and interaction of these genes with other proteins and molecules within the body, the developing of direct and indirect mechanisms to fix p53 is essential. While APR-246 shows great promises to restore p53 function, it still has challenges in mutation specify and safety. Therefore, the ongoing studies and research into biomarkers is important to determine which patients are more likely to response and benefit from the treatment.
